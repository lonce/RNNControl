## RNNControl

Jupyter notebooks that run experiments investigating the effect of conditional parameters on audio synthesis.   
The code here is closely integrated with [AudioDataloader](https://github.com/muhdhuz/AudioDataloader). Clone that repository and run the notebooks from within it.     

**Files**  
* main.ipynb: for training and saving model (an RNN)
* explore_generation.ipynb: to do cool stuff i.e. audio synthesis with the trained model 

**Dependencies**  
* pytorch 0.4.0  
* librosa 0.6.1  

**Authors**  
* Muhammad Huzaifah
